this is a project that mixed with angular and react  
for some reason, the project is based on angular1, but it's big gap to upgrade to angular2/4/5 or react  
to sole the gap, i try to use react in to exist angular project, and reduce the curve of upgrade.


use react component to replace angular1 component piece by piece
